How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

it saved me going through the entire file of code. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

to quickly find errors and revert back to old versions if new ones fail.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pros
flexible. get to choose when to commit.

cons
human error, may forget.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

to save all related files to help keep track of changes.

May not for memory issues.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

log shows what commits have been made
git diff shows the difference between the commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

because you can simply revert to the old version
